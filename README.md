###Disclaimer:
This project is for educational purposes only. What you do with it, is on you. I hold no responsibility
for your actions.

### Info:
I will be adding more to this project over time. Which includes different drivers, threading, etc.

It should work in its current state, with some issues which may arise here and there.

I will be making a web-based version also, in Java.
